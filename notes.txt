use k nearest neighbours - maybe make a graph also with k as parameter

fairness of earnings of various riders



how to generate minimum and maximum bid for delivering the order?
min and max bid is same for all riders for a particular order, but machine predicted bid is dependent on the order, and the rating of the rider

in manual rider selection - check that riders don't demand unnecessarily high bid and present themselves as very good riders, and then you consider good riders are those who have high bid. 



list of graphs
    average queue length
    total distance travelled vs number of orders served
    total wait time of customers vs number of orders served
    distance histogram
    wait time histogram 


SIMULATING RIDER BEHAVIOUR WHILE BIDDING
for calculating 1st, 2nd and 3rd iteration bid of the rider, input to the function is rider rating, minimum and maximum bid by the restaurant, optionally (number of orders served by the rider)
    proportional to rating, number of orders served, min & max bid


SIMULATING RESTAURANT OWNER BEHAVIOUR WHILE BIDDING
dependent on value of the food order
discussed with uday



add order price to the dataset based on the sensitivity of the order, breakfast, lunch, snacks etc. - find out a maximum price of the order say 3000 rs


SIMULATING CUSTOMER RATING
dependent on '''wait time'''
FAALTU - freshness - temperature of food, politeness of rider behaviour
