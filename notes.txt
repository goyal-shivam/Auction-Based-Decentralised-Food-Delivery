use k nearest neighbours - maybe make a graph also with k as parameter

fairness of earnings of various riders



how to generate minimum and maximum bid for delivering the order?
min and max bid is same for all riders for a particular order, but machine predicted bid is dependent on the order, and the rating of the rider

in manual rider selection - check that riders don't demand unnecessarily high bid and present themselves as very good riders, and then you consider good riders are those who have high bid. 



list of graphs
    average queue length
    total distance travelled vs number of orders served
    total wait time of customers vs number of orders served
    distance histogram
    wait time histogram 


SIMULATING RIDER BEHAVIOUR WHILE BIDDING
for calculating 1st, 2nd and 3rd iteration bid of the rider, input to the function is rider rating, minimum and maximum bid by the restaurant, optionally (number of orders served by the rider)
    proportional to rating, number of orders served, min & max bid


SIMULATING RESTAURANT OWNER BEHAVIOUR WHILE BIDDING
dependent on value of the food order and rating of the rider
discussed with uday



add order price to the dataset based on the sensitivity of the order, breakfast, lunch, snacks etc. - find out a maximum price of the order say 3000 rs


SIMULATING CUSTOMER RATING
dependent on '''wait time'''
FAALTU - freshness - temperature of food, politeness of rider behaviour

put probabilistic random choice wherever possible
    uday said something about two variable probability choice function



data generated by reference simulation
    time, queue length
    
    wait time, and distance travelled by rider for every order
    
    
    graphs generated
    - queue length comparison in centralised and decentralised setup, and comparing their averages using horizontal lines
    - wait time & distance histograms separately
    - sum of wait time & total distance curves

graphs to be generated for the auction mechanism
    change in the rider ratings
        histogram of rider rating and also show increase in mean and median rider rating

    net savings of the restaurant per order
        keeping into consideration bike driving cost per kilometer, and the increased tip of the rider
            how these saving increase as the simulation time increases

    
    

perform auction between ceil(total_riders/20) nearest riders, basically return list of their indices to perform_auction function, and get the index of the chosen rider and delivery_charges


inta sab nhi rakhte, sirf per order ka delivery charges and customer_rating rakhte hain, that's it
        total rider_earnings, rider ratings ka histogram, and total value graph as the simulation progresses, customer_ratings ka histogram

update average_customer_rating and average_rider_rating in both the simulations



do 2 changes, make the riders demand bids based on their total time to reach the restaurant, plus distance from restaurant to customer. & customer rating should be 2.5 at 10 times or 8 times or 5 times the most optimised distance

max distance travelled by the rider in our simulation is 100 kms
    base fare is 40 rs, and then 20 rs per km

    first_bid is from 300 to 600


    make according to 40 kms
        first bid is from 0 to 100, second is from 0 to 75, third is from 0 to 50

        machine_predicted_bid goes from 0 to 40 only
