Blockchain is the central point of communication for users, restaurants, and riders. Blockchain-based transactions are privacy-preserving for all three parties involved. Users order food dishes through a DApp. Once a user places an order, a block is formed with the user id, food item id, user address, cost decided and the restaurant id. The auction happens over immutable blockchain transactions. This ensures high security in the bidding process. After the bidding ends,  the restaurant chooses a rider. A block is then created on the blockchain with the food item id, final cost to the rider, user cost, user id, rider id, restaurant id and user address. The delivery agreements between the three parties are formed using smart contracts. When the user asserts the arrival of the ordered food item, the amount automatically debits from the user's account to restaurant's and from the restaurant's account to the rider's.
